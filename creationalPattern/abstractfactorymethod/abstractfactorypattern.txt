Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Remember

A factory is a class that returns products of a particular kind. For example, the ModernFurnitureFactory can only create ModernChair, ModernSofa and ModernCoffeeTable objects.
